# PhotoGeoTag

As part of my graduate thesis, I undertook a project, on which I developed an Android application. The application first identifies the coordinates of the smartphone and then converts them to street location, after this procedure the user can take a photo.
The application detects the faces that are present in the photo, draws squares around each one of them and then displays the photo to the user.
By touching one of the squares, the user, can pick a name from the contact list of the phone.
After that the user can apply filters and based on the location that the photos where taken and the people that are in, the application is able to show a list of photos that satisfy the conditions.
Then the user by touching one of the photos from the list, is able to see it in full screen or present the exact location the photo were taken in Google Maps.
